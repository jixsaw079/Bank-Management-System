# Bank Management System in C

A menu-driven, console-based banking simulation built in **C** as a university learning project. It keeps the implementation in a single C source file and uses standard file I/O to save account records between runs.

> **Educational project only.** This program is not connected to a real bank and is not suitable for real financial data or production use.

## Features

- Create accounts with automatically assigned account numbers
- View all saved accounts and check an account's balance
- Deposit and withdraw money with basic amount and balance checks
- Transfer funds between two different accounts
- Record a loan and repay an outstanding loan
- Handle invalid menu choices, non-numeric input, unknown account numbers, and invalid amounts
- Save account records to `accounts.txt` and load them on the next launch
- Record initial deposits, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, loans, and loan repayments in `transactions.txt`
- View transaction history for a specific account, including date/time, transaction type, amount, and resulting balance
- Append transaction records so history is preserved between program runs
- Save account changes after successful operations and when exiting

## Built with

- **Language:** C (C11-compatible compiler recommended)
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Concepts:** structures, arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, console input/output, and file handling
- **Storage:** local plain-text file

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for cloning the repository)
- GCC or another compatible C compiler
- A terminal, such as the VS Code integrated terminal

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jixsaw079/Bank-Management-System.git
cd Bank-Management-System
```

Alternatively, download the repository as a ZIP and open the extracted folder in VS Code.

### 2. Compile

**Windows (PowerShell with GCC/MinGW):**

```powershell
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic Bank-Management-System.c -o bank.exe
```

**Linux or macOS:**

```bash
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic Bank-Management-System.c -o bank
```

Warnings from the compiler should be reviewed rather than ignored. If your compiler reports a platform-specific issue, use a current GCC version.

### 3. Run

**Windows:**

```powershell
.\bank.exe
```

**Linux or macOS:**

```bash
./bank
```

The program runs in the terminal and presents a numbered menu. Choose an operation by entering its menu number.

## Data persistence

The program stores account records in `accounts.txt` and transaction records in `transactions.txt`, both in the **current working directory** from which it is run. On startup, it attempts to load saved accounts. Successful balance-changing operations append a transaction record to `transactions.txt`; account changes are written back to `accounts.txt`.

Each record uses this format:

```text
accountNumber|name|balance|outstandingLoan
```

- Account numbering starts at `1001` and continues after the highest account number loaded from the file.
- The program supports up to **100 accounts**.
- The pipe character (`|`) is the field separator, so avoid using it in account names.
- The `.gitignore` file excludes both `accounts.txt` and `transactions.txt`, as well as compiled executables, so local generated data is not accidentally committed.

**Important:** Keep both `accounts.txt` and `transactions.txt` if you want to preserve local test records and their history. Deleting either file removes that file's saved data from the program's view. Do not put real or sensitive personal information in these files.

## Known limitations

- This is a learning exercise, not production banking software.
- Account data is stored in plain text without authentication, encryption, or database-level protection.
- The program uses `float` for monetary values; real financial systems should use a carefully designed representation such as integer minor units or a suitable decimal type.
- Loan requests are recorded immediately for demonstration; there is no credit assessment or approval workflow.
- Transaction history is a simple local text log; it is not tamper-proof and does not provide database transactions or crash recovery.
- There is no concurrent-user handling or transaction recovery mechanism.
- Input validation is basic and the program is intended for local, single-user use.

## What this project demonstrates

- Defining and using a `struct` to represent an account
- Managing a collection of records with an array
- Separating tasks into functions
- Validating console input and checking account operations
- Reading and writing structured records with `fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`, and `fclose`
- Appending transaction records and formatting local date/time with the C time library
- Using Git and GitHub to version and publish a project

## Testing

See [the manual testing checklist](docs/TESTING.md) for suggested scenarios covering account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, loans, invalid input, and persistence across restarts.

## Academic note

This project was developed for learning and demonstration. Be prepared to explain the code and the design decisions in your own words during an assignment presentation or viva.
